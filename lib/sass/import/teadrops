Whenever I hear goodbyes, remind me baby of you
I break down and cry, next time I'll be true, yeah
Fever for lost romance remind me baby of you
I took a crazy chance
Next time I'll be true, I'll be true, I'll be true
Footsteps on the dance floor remind me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes, next time I'll be true, yeah
Whispers in the powder room
"She cries on every tune, every tune, every tune"

When I'm dancin' 'round, remind me baby of you
I really let you down, next time I'll be true, yeah
I took a crazy chance
"She cries on every tune, every tune, every tune"

Footsteps on the dance floor remind me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes, next time I'll be true, yeah
Whispers in the powder room
"She cries on every tune, every tune, every tune"

And the music don't feel like it did when I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like I felt it with you

Hurting deep inside, she cries on every tune
I break down and cry
"She cries on every tune, every tune, every tune"

Footsteps on the dance floor remind me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes, next time I'll be true, yeah
Whispers in the powder room


I'm not aware of too many things,
but I know what I know if you know what I mean.
Philosophy is the talk on a cereal box.
Religion is the smile on a dog.
I'm not aware of too many things,
but I know what I know if you know what I mean.
Choke me in the shallow water before I get too deep.
What I am is what I am.
Are you what you are - or what?
I'm not aware of too many things,
but I know what I know if you know what I mean.
Philosophy is a walk on the slippery rocks.
Religion is a light in the fog.
I'm not aware of too many things,
but I know what I know if you know what I mean.
Choke me in the shallow water before I get too deep.
What I am is what I am.
Are you what you are - or what?
Don't let me get too deep. 
"She cries on every tune, every tune, every tune"
